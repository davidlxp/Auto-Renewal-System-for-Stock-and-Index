############ Note That ############

# Don't worry if the code couldn't run, and returned [Keyerror:'Date'] at the end of the error
# it means you already have all data that could get in the database

# Cause of Error: We can't get index data from yahoo finance between dates which has no market data. This means 
#                 both start, end dates and days between them which we try to get data from are all market-off dates. 
#                 In short, it means from the last date in the database to the current date, the US stock market is off,
#                 and there is no new data need to get.
